# CDC_Data_Analysis
*Final project for UC Berkeley course Data C102 (Data, Inference, and Decisions)*

With the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how individuals who suffer from
chronic illnesses are more susceptible to serious implications from the infection than those
without. Moreso, chronic illnesses account for seven of the ten leading causes of death in the
United States, three of which are considered preventable deaths, including death from chronic
tobacco use and alcohol consumption.

Current events have shed light on the severity of chronic illnesses, and we believe it is important
to look for strategies to prevent these diseases. This may be achieved by analyzing how air
pollution and chronic illnesses are related. In our research, we specifically aim to answer the
questions “do increased levels of air pollution correspond with increased levels of Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?” and “do increased regulations correspond with
decreased chronic illnesses?” We use the following CDC datasets to perform our analysis:
* CDC: Annual State-Level U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Chronic-Disease-Indicators/U-S-Chronic-Disease-Indicators-CDI-/g4ie-h725)
* CDC: Daily Census-Tract PM2.5 Concentrations (https://data.cdc.gov/Environmental-Health-Toxicology/Daily-Census-Tract-Level-PM2-5-Concentrations-2011/fcqm-xrf4)

We also referred to ELI Database of State IAQ Laws2 which gave us access to the various state policies that have been implemented to improve indoor air quality. (https://www.eli.org/buildings/database-state-indoor-air-quality-laws)
